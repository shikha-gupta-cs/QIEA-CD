****Code information****

We have proposed two algorithms:
1. Binary chromosome QIEA
2. Numeric chromosome QIEA

Code folder contains the serial and the parallel (CUDA-based) versions of these algorithms.

qieaBinChromosome.c: Serial Binary chromosome QIEA
qieaNumChromosome.c: Serial Numeric chromosome QIEA
qieaBinChromosome.cu: Parallel Binary chromosome QIEA
qieaNumChromosome.cu: Parallel Numeric chromosome QIEA


***Shell script files***

Provided as examples to understand the running of the code.


***Environement used to run the code***

The proposed algorithms were run on Dell Precision T7610 having Intel Xeon CPU E5-2620 v2 $@$ 2.10 GHz X17 and NVIDIA Tesla K40 graphics processing unit (GPU) running ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 32 GB RAM, and 1.5 TB HDD.
